<ol start="19">
    <li><strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against
    ILLUMU on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration AGREEMENT. This will preclude you
    from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against ILLUMU, and also preclude you from
    participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative
    action brought against ILLUMU by someone else.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arbitration Procedure</strong>. You and Illumu agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
        of or relating to (i) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
        thereof, or (ii) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed
        to the Terms will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Illumu, and not in a court of law. The
        arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") in accordance
        with the AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
        (the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The parties
        agree that the arbitrator (&ldquo;<strong>Arbitrator</strong>&rdquo;), and not any federal, state, or local
        court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any
        part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in
        the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving
        interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, (&ldquo;<strong>FAA</strong>&rdquo;), will govern its
        interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA
        and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are
        found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then
        that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of New York. The Arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be
        final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
        equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party shall be
        entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and
        claims in regard to these Terms or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or
        indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms. The entire dispute, including the scope and
        enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
        THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. This Arbitration
        Agreement shall survive the termination of these Terms.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Exceptions to Our Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</strong>. There are only two exceptions to this
        Agreement to arbitrate: (i) if either party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner violated
        or threatened to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party whose rights have been
        violated may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief without bond in any court of competent
        jurisdiction or (ii) each party will retain the right to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or
        claims within the scope of the jurisdiction of such courts.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who Bears the Costs of Arbitration?</strong> You and Illumu agree that payment of all filing,
        administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules unless otherwise stated in this
        Agreement to arbitrate. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be
        frivolous or without merit, you agree that Illumu is relieved of its obligation to reimburse you for any fees
        associated with the arbitration.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>. Notwithstanding any provision in this
        Agreement to the contrary, You and We agree that if We make any amendment to this Agreement to arbitrate in the
        future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Illumu prior to
        the effective date of the amendment. However, the amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed
        by the Agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Illumu If you do not agree to these
        amended terms, you shall not access or use the Services, and the revised terms will not bind you.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes</strong>. If the Agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to
        you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to
        arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or court order, you agree (except as otherwise provided
        by law) that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Illumu must be resolved
        exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York. You and Illumu agree to submit to
        the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts situated in New York County, New York, for the purpose of
        litigating all such claims or disputes.
    </li>

        this Agreement and this Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to
        arbitrate does not affect any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Illumu
